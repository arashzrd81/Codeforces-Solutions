# Codeforces-Solutions
Codeforces.com is one of the best websites to practice algorithm design and implement fastest ways to solve problems. Problems on Codeforces are categorized according to
tags (skills needed to solve each problem) and complexity in solving. For example, a problem with a rate of 1700 definitely requires more skill to solve than a problem
with a rate of 900. The execution time of the code that you upload as a response is also very important so that you may solve many problems, but the execution time of
your answer code is longer than the execution time specified in the problem and thus your answer will not be accepted. To solve problems in Codeforces, it is better to
use C++ language. Programming languages such as Python or JavaScript, may have a variety of features and functions that make it easy for the programmer to work, but C++
is a lower level language than them, and this can lead to code execution time and on the other hand, it has more features than C language. In this repository, I solved
problems with rates of 1000, 1100 and 1200, and for the future, if I have time and I can, I will definitely solve problems with higher rates and put it in this
repository, because I am personally very interested in I design algorithms and solve problems and it gives me a lot of fun.
